# Data Engineering Project: Spotify ETL with Apache Airflow

## Project Overview
In this project, will demonstrate how to create a simple ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and automate the process through Apache airflow.

### Problem Statement:
We need to use Spotify’s API to read the data and perform some basic transformations and Data Quality checks finally will load the retrieved data to sqlite db/PostgreSQL DB and then automate the entire process through airflow.
